        <div class="a">The automotive industry in India is one of the
            main pillars of the economy. With strong
            backward and forward linkages, it is a key driver
            of growth. Liberalization and conscious policy
            interventions over the past few years created a
            vibrant, competitive market, and brought
            several new players, resulting in capacity
            expansion of the automobile industry and
            generation of huge employment.1
            The contribution of this sector to the National
            GDP has risen to about 7.1% now from 2.77% in 1992-93. It provides direct and indirect
            employment to over 19 million people.
