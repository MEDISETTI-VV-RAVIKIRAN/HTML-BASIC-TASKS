        <p>The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, government, and business customers created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers. Some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. Others were done on a commercial basis, and other firms such as Computer Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959) started to grow. Other influential or typical software companies begun in the early 1960s included Advanced Computer Techniques, Automatic Data Processing, Applied Data Research, and Informatics General.[3][4] The computer/hardware makers started bundling operating systems, systems software and programming environments with their machines.

            When Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) brought a relatively low-priced microcomputer to market, it brought computing within the reach of many more companies and universities worldwide, and it spawned great innovation in terms of new, powerful programming languages and methodologies. New software was built for microcomputers, so other manufacturers including IBM, followed DEC's example quickly, resulting in the IBM AS/400 amongst others.</p>

        <p>To position India at a global level in Electronics System Design and Manufacturing and to accomplish the vision of the National Policy on Electronics 2019, three schemes were introduced, by the government. The Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) was one of these three schemes.The Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme (EMC 2.0) and Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) were the other two schemes notified in April 2020.

            A first scheme, the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for IT Hardware, is the latest scheme notified by the government in March 2021. India allows 100 per cent FDI in business and management consultancy services, computer consultancy services, data processing, technical testing services and market research services under the automatic route.
            
            In addition, India allows 100 percent FDI in business-to-business( B2B) e-commerce to garner foreign capital and grow its IT software and hardware capabilities. From April 2000 to March 2021, India received FDI worth 71.05 billion USD in computer software and hardware manufacturing. </p>
